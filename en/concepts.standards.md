The air quality standard, also sometimes referred to as a "norm" or a "guideline", is a specific concentration of a concrete component of air pollution, which is considered as an acceptable limit. Pollutants exceeding this value may have negative impact on our health, and the more they exceed the limit the greater the impact may be. Air quality standards are defined by the national and international health organizations, e.g. the [World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/airpollution/en/) (WHO).

In the Airly API, we provide the standard values of PM10 and PM2.5. The API response contains the standard (limit) value and the pollutant concentration expressed as a percentage of the limit.
