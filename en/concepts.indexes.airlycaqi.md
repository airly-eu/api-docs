### AirlyCAQI | concepts.indexes.airlycaqi

The highest level of the CAQI index starts at 100 index value and it doesn't show further changes in pollution in intuitive way. Unfortunately, in Poland during the winter season, the level of dust concentrations often exceeds and remains above 100 CAQI on large areas, sometimes around the clock. To better illustrate this problem, we decided to introduce additional CAQI levels with assigned color values. This is how the **AirlyCAQI** index was created. The AirlyCAQI numeric value is calculated exactly the same as for CAQI, it differs only in the definition of levels for the highest pollution concentrations. It also has more levels (7, while CAQI defines only 5) and colors that are a little nicer, chosen especially for our platform. The AirlyCAQI index is the default index returned by the API.
