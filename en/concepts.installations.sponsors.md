### Sponsors | concepts.installations.sponsors

An installation sponsor is some sort of organization or institution that purchased our sensor. Usually that would be local authorities (e.g. city or county), but also private companies and individual customers. We have also given away many devices during some campaigns, such as [#PolskaOddycha](https://www.facebook.com/PolskaOddychaAirly/) or [#Krak√≥wOddycha](https://airly.org/pl/krakowoddycha-z-airlybirds/).

Information about who is the sponsor of particular installation are available on our platform, both in the API and on our [map](https://airly.org/map/). By presenting particular brand or city on our platform, we kind of want to say "thank you" to our customers for joining the fight for clean air. The API provides: name, logo (url to image file) and a link to sponsor's website.

When presenting our data in a public place (e.g. your application or website) there is no requirement to show who is the sponsor of that installation, although it can't be presented in a way that is vague or misleading. E.g. if you are just displaying an average from multiple installations for the entire city, you should state that clearly.
