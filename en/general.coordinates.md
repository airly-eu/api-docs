## Coordinates | general.coordinates

All coordinates that occur in the API (both as query parameters and as returned payload fields) are according to [WGS 84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) standard.

Coordinates are a pair of numbers named `latitude` (or `lat`) and `longitude` (`lng`) and represent [decimal degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decimal_degrees) i.e.  degrees without minutes or seconds, but instead as floating point numbers with fractional part representing fraction of a degree.

 `latitude` (`lat`) values can range from -90.0 to +90.0, and `longitude` (`lng`) values can range from -180.0 to +180.0.
